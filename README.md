Chinese Text:
此程序采用 Python + Flask + Jinja2;
含有部分 HTML，CSS
本意是分享给玩MC的同好们使用的，用以发布自己的整合包，写的比较简单，如果没有HTML和Python基础的也可以上手即用，如果有问题可以留言。
此程序也会不断的更新，目前的一个小目标是增加一个用户注册/登入以及内置的网页群聊功能。
  
Englis Text:
This program uses Python + Flask + Jinja2;
Contains some HTML, CSS
The intention is to share to play MC friends to use, release their own integration package, write relatively simple, if there is no HTML and Python         foundation can also be used, if there is a problem can leave a message.
The app will also be constantly updated, and a small goal for now is to add user registration/login and built-in web group chat capabilities.
